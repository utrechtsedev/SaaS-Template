# SaaS SvelteKit Template

This is my first publicly released SvelteKit template. I use this template for my personal website https://innovatieweb.nl. You can use this as-is without my permission.

### To setup
```bash
# Navigate to this directory
npm i

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

You may need to change the adapter in /svelte.config.js. I am deploying to Vercel, that's why I'm using the Vercel adapter.
